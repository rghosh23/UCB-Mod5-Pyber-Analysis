# Pyber Ride Sharing Data Analysis
## Overview of Ride-Sharing data analysis
As a new analyst at Pyber, the goal is to create a compelling visualization of the ride-share data that can help the CEO understannd how to improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
### Purpose
The objective of this analysis is to use Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize how weekly fares are impacted by each city type. By generating a clean dataframe and plotting it in a line chart, it is easier for decision-makers at Pyber to take the right steps to employ the proper resources that can further the growth of Pyber.
## Results

From the summarized dataframe above, we can see that:
- There are approximately **13 times more** *urban rides than rural rides*. (there is **5 times more** *suburban rides than rural*)
- There are approximately **30 times more** *urban drivers than rural drivers*. (There is **6 times times more** *suburban drivers than rural*)
- *Urban rides* generate approximately **10 times more** total fare than rural rides. (*Suburban rides* generate **5 times times more** revenue than rural)
- *Urban rides* have the **lowest average fare per ride and per driver**, where as *rural rides* have the **highest average fare per ride and per driver**

From the line chart summary of the fares per week from Jan to April of 2019 of each city type, we can see:
- The fares of each city type stayed consistent over Jan to April 2019 (ALthough there seems to be a minor peak in the last week of February for all city types)
- Rural fares per week remained at $500 or below, suburban fares ranged approximately between $650-1500, and urban fares ranged approximately between $1500-2500

## Summary
While fare per week in each city type is consistent over the first quarter of 2019, there are some stark differences in the revenue generated by each city type. Based on the data analysis and the trends, these are the recommendations for the CEO.

### Recommendations for the business:
- Continue to foster urban revenue, since they have the most riders and thus have 10 times more revenue than rural and 2 times more revenue than suburban. Secondly foster suburban revenue since they contribute to a significant portion of the revenue. 
- Decrease the number of urban drivers. Even though there are 30 times more urban drivers compared to rural, the revenue does not reflect the same numbers
- Increase the number of rural drivers. Rural rides have high average fare per ride and per driver showing that the number of drivers arent really meeting the demand for rides, and this might even lead to missed revenue in rural fares.
